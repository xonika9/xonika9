Hi! I am 29 years old, living in Moscow, and leading a frontend development team at RSHB-Intech. I help build effective processes and create an environment where every developer can grow and improve banking products.

I am constantly learning new things, and am particularly passionate about AI and self-hosting. I actively read and experiment with LLMs for routine automation. I have my own "digital garden"—a couple of servers on Hetzner where various useful services run. I run a [Telegram channel](https://t.me/+sVGIQdVw0WljYzIy) about AI and development.

In my free time, I am a street photographer, shooting with a Canon D60 35mm f/1.8, trying to capture that 'magic moment' in spontaneous scenes and faces. I love to travel, discovering new cities and landscapes; it's the best way to refresh my mind and fill myself with new experiences.

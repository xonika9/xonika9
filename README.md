I believe that the best digital products are not created in a vacuum, but at the intersection of three things: a deep understanding of business goals, engineering empathy, and genuine curiosity about user problems. My career is a conscious movement in these three directions.

As a leader, I don't just manage a team — I create an environment where technological solutions directly impact business metrics. My goal is to transform strategy into working code and ensure that every developer understands the exact value they are creating for the client and the company right now.

My passion for technology extends beyond work. I am convinced that one can only truly understand the capabilities of AI by getting "hands-on" with it. That's why I run my "digital garden" on Hetzner, where I experiment with LLMs and self-hosted services to automate routine tasks. This practical experience helps me distinguish real technological trends from hype and find unconventional solutions for products. I share my discoveries in the Telegram channel ["Controlled Hallucinations"](https://t.me/+-EFTWfVwM1M5YTMy).

In my free time, I'm a street photographer, shooting with a Canon D60 35mm f/1.8, trying to capture that "magic moment" in random scenes and faces. I love to travel, discovering new cities and landscapes; it's the best way to clear my mind and fill up with new impressions.

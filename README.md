I believe that the best digital products are created not in a vacuum, but at the intersection of three things: a deep understanding of business goals, engineering empathy, and genuine curiosity about user problems. My career is a conscious movement in these three directions.

As a leader, I don't just manage a team — I create an environment where technological solutions directly impact business metrics. My task is to transform strategy into working code and ensure that every developer understands the precise value they are creating for the client and the company right now.

My passion for technology extends beyond work. I am convinced that one can truly understand the capabilities of AI only by "getting hands-on" with it. That's why I maintain my "digital garden" on Hetzner, where I experiment with LLMs and self-hosted services to automate routine tasks. This practical experience helps me distinguish real technological trends from hype and find unconventional solutions for products. I share my findings on the Telegram channel ["Controlled Hallucinations"](https://t.me/+-EFTWfVwM1M5YTMy).

And to not lose focus on the human element in the world of technology, I engage in street photography. This teaches me to observe, notice details, and find the "magic of the moment" in ordinary scenes — a skill surprisingly similar to discovering the true user "pain points" during interviews.

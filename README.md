# Hi there, me name is Alex ðŸ‘‹

## About me

For more than 6 years I have been actively developing websites on WordPress. Website of a [medical organization](https://irgpc.ru/), [charity project](https://xn--80abh4ara1ao.xn--p1ai/), [commercial organization](https://timber.krona-baikal.com/).

I am proficient in [pure JS](https://xonika9.github.io/mesto/) and [MERN stack](https://github.com/xonika9/movies-explorer-frontend). I know how to configure, run and deploy code to the server.

I solve problems on Leetcode and Codewars. I know what is SSR, SSG and SPA and their pros/cons. Worked with NoSQL database MongoDB, understand the differences from SQL. Interested in backend development.

Above all, I have a great desire to work as a Frontend developer for a product company that helps people solve their problems and challenges every day.

My coworkers jokingly call me "the table man" because I prefer consistency in everything and am always guided by accurate data.

I am an excellent team player and have experience in conducting code reviews, have UI/UX insights and can create effective briefs for websites.

In addition, I have a high level of foreign language skills, as well as a deep knowledge of management and finance. I follow the latest trends in frontend development and take pride in writing about copyright in the digital age.

Outside of work, I have a passion for street photography and can often be caught shooting with my trusty Canon 35mm lens. In winter I like to go skiing or ice skating. And in the summer, we go to the countryside with friends or rent bikes.

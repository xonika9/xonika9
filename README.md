    The best digital products are born at the intersection of three worlds: a deep understanding of business goals, engineering empathy, and genuine curiosity about user problems. My entire career is a conscious journey through these three directions.
</p>
<p>
    As a product leader, I don't just manage a backlog – I create an environment where technological solutions directly impact business metrics. My task is to transform strategy into working code and ensure that every developer understands the exact value they are creating for the client and the company right now.
</p>
<p>
    My passion for technology is not limited to work. I am convinced that to truly understand the capabilities of AI, one must "touch" it with their own hands. That's why I maintain my "digital garden" on Hetzner, where I experiment with LLMs and self-hosted services for routine automation. This practical experience helps me distinguish real technological trends from hype and find non-trivial solutions for products. I share my findings in the Telegram channel <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://t.me/+-EFTWfVwM1M5YTMy">«Controlled Hallucinations»</a>.
</p>
<p>
    In my free time, I am a street photographer, shooting with a Canon D60 35mm f/1.8, trying to capture that "magic moment" in random scenes and faces. I love to travel, discovering new cities and landscapes; it's the best way to clear my cache and fill myself with new impressions.

    <i>August 2023 — Present</i>&nbsp;<br>
    IT division of Rosselkhozbank. I manage the full lifecycle of two key products: a B2C marketplace for the sale of pledged property and an internal platform for working with the borrower registry. I am responsible for discovery, product strategy, backlog, and achieving business metrics.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Increased conversion to registration on the B2C marketplace from 1% to 15%</strong> by initiating product research and eliminating a key barrier in the CJM — an excessively complex onboarding form.

    <li class="text-start">
        <strong>Eliminated the lack of development resources as a key product development blocker</strong> by initiating and implementing a plan to double the team (from 3 to 6 people). This accelerated time-to-market and allocated resources for technical debt repayment.

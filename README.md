# Hi there, me name is Alex ðŸ‘‹

## About me

Since 2015 I have been actively developing websites on WordPress Website of a [medical organization](https://irgpc.ru/), [charity project](https://xn--80abh4ara1ao.xn--p1ai/), [commercial organization](https://timber.krona-baikal.com/).

In 2022 I started studying JavaScript. I have experience in developing websites on [pure JS](https://xonika9.github.io/mesto/) as well as on the [MERN stack](https://github.com/xonika9/movies-explorer-frontend). I know how to configure, run and deploy code to the server.

Above all, I have a great desire to work as a Frontend developer for a product company that helps people solve their problems and challenges every day.

My coworkers jokingly call me "the table man" because I prefer consistency in everything and am always guided by accurate data.

I am an excellent team player and have experience in conducting code reviews, have UI/UX insights and can create effective briefs for websites.

In addition, I have a high level of foreign language skills, as well as a deep knowledge of management and finance. I follow the latest trends in frontend development and take pride in writing about copyright in the digital age.

Outside of work, I have a passion for street photography and can often be caught shooting with my trusty Canon 35mm lens. In winter I like to go skiing or ice skating. And in the summer, we go to the countryside with friends or rent bikes.

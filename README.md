## About me

I have been actively involved in web application development for more than 7 years. I am currently working as a lead frontend developer at [RSHB-Intech](https://rshb-intech.ru/rshb-intech).

I solve Leetcode and Codewars tasks. I know what SSR, SSG and SPA are and their pros/cons. Worked with NoSQL database MongoDB, understand the differences from SQL. I am interested in backend development.

First of all, I have a great desire to work as a Frontend developer in a product company that helps people solve their problems and tasks on a daily basis.

My colleagues jokingly call me "the table man" because I favor systematicity in everything and am always guided by accurate data.

I am a great team player and have experience in code reviews, have UI/UX savvy and can create effective functional requirements for web applications.

In addition, I have a high level of foreign language proficiency as well as in-depth knowledge of management and finance. I follow the latest trends in frontend development and take pride in writing articles on copyright in the digital age.

Outside of work, I have a passion for street photography and can often be caught shooting with my trusty Canon 35mm lens. In the winter I like to go skiing or ice skating. And in summer, my friends and I go to the countryside or rent bikes.

Skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Hooks, Next.js, Redux Toolkit, Jest, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, REST API, Git, GitHub, GitLab, Webpack, Vite, ESLint, Babel, npm, yarn, BEM, SCSS, Sass, LESS, CSS-in-JS, TailwindCSS, MUI, Bootstrap, Wordpress, Figma, Canva Ð¸ Photoshop.
Also exploring new frameworks and libraries.
